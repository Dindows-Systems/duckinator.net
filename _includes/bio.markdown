I'm the resident server kicker at [official.fm labs](http://labs.official.fm), where we teach the web how to [sing](http://codecs.ofmlabs.org).

I'm a monkey's uncle, and love discussing most things related to math, software, or hardware. You may know me as "duckinator" on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/duckinator) and [GitHub](http://github.com/duckinator). I'm also available on [Google+](http://duckinator.net/+).
