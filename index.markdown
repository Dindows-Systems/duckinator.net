## About the site ##

This site's being basically entirely rewritten...very slowly. I'll eventually finish.

In the mean time, <a href="http://pi.duckinator.net">you're helping me calculate the value of Pi.</a>

A script loaded from <a href="http://pi.duckinator.net">pi.duckinator.net</a> calculates the value of Pi in small bursts (usually about 27 digits at a time), using visitors to various sites. It's merely an experiment with distributed calculations and the limitations of JavaScript. By including a single script (and, optionally, a single element with the ID "picalc") you can provide data for it, as well. See <a href="http://pi.duckinator.net">pi.duckinator.net</a> for more information.
