title: Dux

## A brief overview ##

Dux is a new and constantly changing [Operating System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system). Its goals are to have a simple overall design, be portable, and be easy to develop for.
The project began in late 2008 as an experiment, and it quickly became a regular project.
As time went on, more people joined and several revisions of dux were created, leaving a clean and well designed core that will be both fast and extendable.
On August 2nd, 2009, we started development of the [metodo kernel](metodo), which is now the kernel dux is built around.

## API ##

Dux's API is a specification for each version of dux released, starting at v0.1.0.
The API can be implemented freely in *any operating system* if they wish to be compatible.
It will not follow POSIX by design, but POSIX compatibility will not be actively avoided.

[API documentation](api/v0.1.0) is available for the upcoming release of Dux v0.1.0.

### API Finalization ###

The Dux v0.1.0 API was planned to be finalized on March 14, 2011. After multiple date bumps it's now planned to be finalized on June 01, 2011.

## What's with the name? ##
I was given the nickname duck, courtesy of my friend Ashley, in my sophomore year of high school.  Over time, everybody I know started calling me duck.  When I asked a friend what I should call my Operating System, she said, "dux."

I'm assuming they're related.

Dux was made possible by many people doing various tasks to keep everything going.
