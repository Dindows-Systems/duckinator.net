## Dux's <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> ##

The UI design I came up took ideas from VIM[<sup id="h1">[1]</sup>](#f1), AutoCAD[<sup>[1]</sup>](#f1), and Mac OS[<sup>[1]</sup>](#f1).
If you are in *command mode*, the `insert` key puts you in *input mode* which lets you directly interact with the program.
If you are in *input mode*, the `escape` key puts you in *command mode* which lets you type commands in the command box and run them.

### Input mode ###

Input mode lets you directly interact with the program. Unless specified through some special thing I have yet to devise, the `insert` key will always put you in *input mode*.

### Command mode ###

In command mode, you can send commands to the program (In the [quick mockup of the UI](01_main.png) you can see a demonstration of using a text editor) by typing them and hitting enter.
Unless specified through aforementioned special thing I have yet to devise, the `escape` key will always place you in *command mode*.

### Menus ###

There are 3 menus in the top bar. **Dux**, **Windows**, and the *current program* menus.

*  The [**Dux** menu](02_dux_menu.png) is normal system administration.
*  The [**Windows** menu](03_windows_menu.png) is a list of open windows, and lets you switch between them.
*  The [*current program* menu](04_text_editor_menu.png) is a menu with options specific to the current program that is open. The name of this menu matches the program you are using.
