# Dux API #

## Overview ##

This is a specification for the APIs planned to be used by dux starting at v0.1.0, and may be modified or replaced.

APIs are striked out if they're not started, followed by a question mark if started but incomplete. Others are finished, and have no *expected* changes.

List of APIs:

* [Text?](text):       Text manipulation and formatting.
* [Console?](console): Console control system, including printing text ("Display" in v0.0.6 and earlier).
* [<del>Image</del>](image):     Image rendering, manipulation, and formatting.
* [<del>Display</del>](display): Desktop management, image displaying.
* [<del>Network</del>](network): Network connectivity, network driver management, etc.
* [<del>VFS</del>](vfs):         Virtual File System support.
* [CPU](cpu):         Provides information about all CPUs on the system. May eventually be able to adjust CPU configurations.
