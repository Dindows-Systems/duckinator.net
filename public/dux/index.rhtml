## A brief overview ##

Dux is a new and constantly changing [Operating System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) with goals to have a simple overall design, be easy to port to new architectures, and easy to create new software for. It uses the equally new and changing [metodo kernel](/dux/metodo).
Although it is designed to be portable, at the moment it only runs on [x86](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x86) systems.
The dux project began in late 2008 as an experiment which soon became a regular project over the next few months.
As time went on, more people joined and several revisions of dux were created, leaving a clean and well designed core that will be both fast and extendable.

## What's with the name? ##
I was given the nickname duck, courtesy of my friend Ashley, my sophomore year of highschool.  Over time pretty much everybody I know started calling me duck.  When I asked a friend what I should call my Operating System, she said "dux."

I'm assuming they're related.

## The dux team ##
Dux was made possible by many people doing various tasks to help keep everything going.
I, and the rest of the group, would like to thank everyone involved (grouped by tasks):
