All of the following appear to have been successfully migrated, including DNS records at NameCheap:

* duckinator.net
* www.duckinator.net
* anatra.duckinator.net
* mail.duckinator.net
* blog.duckinator.net
* misc.duckinator.net
* home.duckinator.net

Email appears to be working, as well! This means once I finish rewriting my gallery in ruby the entire migration will be complete.
