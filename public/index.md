## A little about me ##
My name is Nick Markwell, also known as duck (or online as "duckinator"). I have been programming since 2005, and pick up new languages quickly.
I strongly support [open source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) as well as both the [MIT/X11 license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) and [ISC license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_License).
