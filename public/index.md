If you are seeing this, duckinator.net has successfully migrated from dreamhost to duostack. All subdomains are in the process of being migrated to duostack or my VPS.
DNS for email has *not updated properly* as of the time I wrote this. Hopefully the not-yet-propogated update I just finished should fix it within the next few hours.
