Some info on a robot Joe (ttech) and I (duckinator) are working on.<br>
<br>
Brains: laptop<br>
Control: breadboard(s), possibly an arduino or two<br>
Chasis: likely custom - wheels, motors, axles, gearbox(es), frame<br>
<br>
It will use tractor drive (speed up wheels on left side to go right, and vice-versa).<br>
<br>
Note to self: Look at <a href="http://www.displayduino.com/">http://www.displayduino.com/</a> sometime.
