## Some Background

Quite often I find myself helping people with technical issues. Honestly, I love it. I get to help them learn about technology that was previously a total mystery to them. It's awesome, in the old sense of the word, to see them go from unable to use a computer to having a job that requires using one on a daily basis. I cannot explain how much I enjoy being a part of those sort of transitions.

## The Mood-Killer

The point of this blog post is not to call anyone out, I'm just listing examples that come to mind. The lack of names is intentional: the sole purpose is to provide _examples_, and _not_ to offend anyone. If you get mad later on, re-read this paragraph a few times.

In no particular order:

* Cable box remote didn't work: "Where did you aim it?" Their response was "Oh, I aimed it at the wall." followed by a remark about how they've been using remotes longer than I've been alive. Later: _"It was a stupid question."_
* Laptop wouldn't start: "Is it plugged in, and is the battery in all the way?" "Well, duh. Fucking idiot."
* Desktop wouldn't start: "Has it been acting funny recently?" "Well yea, jackass, it wouldn't start."

I'm going to stop there. Those are exact quotes, and they get _worse_.

## The Problem

This is all needlessly offensive. If someone is trying to assist you, give them the benefit of the doubt and _assume the questions are well-intended._ Why? Because if they've bothered helping you, _they are at least being nice._ Being nice usually implies _caring enough to not be a complete asshole._

A big part of problem solving is checking for simple solutions _first._ Your TV doesn't work? The first thing to do isn't disassemble it and make sure it's perfectly wired, it's _check that the damn thing is plugged in._

I understand how _out of context_ these sort of questions _might_ be taken offensively, but you have context. You are _part of_ the context. You know damn well that it is to help you.

Don't take those sort of questions as an insult, take them as they are: a way to avoid wasting half a day disassembling a TV, computer, or whatever is acting funny, only to find out that your dog sat on the power cord and pulled it out of the wall.

You are not entitled to assistance, you are offered it. Treating those who help you like human beings instead of verbal punching bags would be a great way to insure you get help in the future.

## Final words

There is no such thing as a "stupid question." There are only _seemingly_ stupid questions. Ones that appear "stupid" to you because you don't know their purpose. If someone is helping you with something, assume their _seemingly_ stupid questions are meant to help you, not hurt you. Talk to them with the respect you want them to give you. If you don't understand something, ask. That is _not_ the same as asserting you are correct about _the very thing you asked for help with._
