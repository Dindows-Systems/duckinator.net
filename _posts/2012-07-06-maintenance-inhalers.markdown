Asthma inhalers, despite what many believe, come in two main types.

The more well known of the two is probably the _rescue inhaler:_ this is what an asthmatic suffering from an asthma attack uses for immediate relief.
The long-term goal of asthma treatments is to _never need it._ That's a rather lofty goal, so the short-term goal of asthma treatments is to make it _needed as rarely as possible with the available medications and treatments._

There's also the _maintenance inhaler:_ this is what's used, usually alongside allergy medications and the like, to keep asthma from acting up as often. These can have a drastic effect. The previous maintenance inhaler I used, *Symbicort*, took me from needing to use my rescue inhaler three to four times a day, to only using it once a day.

Then it started. The reason I had to _use_ Symbicort to start with had come back to bite me yet again. It seems that _aside from being surrounded by asthma triggers_ (things that set off my asthma), my asthma is very well controlled.
