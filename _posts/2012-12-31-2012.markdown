This year, particularly the past two months have been absolutely amazing. I've been introduced to some truly incredible people, started getting back into art, learned quite a bit about myself and the people around me, and -- pardon the language (I try to keep my website PG) -- I freaked the fuck out multiple times. To the point I scared myself. But...I got through it, because of the amazing people I mentioned above.

I've recently found myself relying on people I barely know just to keep my feet on the ground, and it's been quite a humbling experience. I also found myself questioning many things -- why I am living where I am, why I hadn't gotten a new job yet, why I associate with some of the people I do, why I don't treat some of my friends better, _my sexuality._ At least one of those got answered (hint: it's the last one). It was quite jarring to realize I'd built my entire life around "proving" I was straight to stop the harassment and teasing, only to find out I'm not straight.
