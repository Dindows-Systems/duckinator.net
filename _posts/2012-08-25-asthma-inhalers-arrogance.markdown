## Or, _How your disbelief can land me in the hospital._

It seems that _aside from being surrounded by asthma triggers_ (things that, for me, often trigger asthma attacks), my asthma is very well controlled. This is a very good thing. The misconceptions most people seem to have regarding asthma and asthma medications, however, are not so good. Hopefully I can clear some things up here.

### What _is_ Asthma?

I'll start this post off with a rather simplified explanation of asthma: asthma is caused by spasms in the _bronchi_ of the lungs, which leads to -- sometimes very severe -- difficulty breathing. Asthma _triggers_ are things that can trigger asthma attacks; they vary from person to person, can change as they get older, and can change _depending on how tired they are, or their emotional state at the time,_ among many other things. It's often, but not always, due to an allergic reaction. It can also be triggered by other forms of hypersensitivity -- for me, most strong smells can trigger an asthma attack. I am more prone to asthma attacks when I'm tired or highly stressed. For some people, it's quite a bit more mild. For others, it's far more extreme.

### The medications

Asthma inhalers, despite what many believe, come in two main types.

The more well known of the two is probably the _rescue inhaler:_ this is what an asthmatic suffering from an asthma attack uses for immediate relief.
The long-term goal of asthma treatments is to _never need it._ That's a rather lofty goal, so the short-term goal of asthma treatments is to make the rescue inhaler _needed as rarely as possible, using the available medications and treatments._

There's also the _maintenance inhaler:_ this is what's used, usually alongside allergy medications and the like, to keep asthma from acting up as often. These can have a drastic effect. The previous maintenance inhaler I used, *Symbicort*, took me from needing to use my rescue inhaler three to four times a day, to only using it once a day.

Along with the inhalers, allergy medications of various sorts are often prescribed -- I am on *Singulair* and *Loratadine* at the moment.

### Overview of my Asthma treatments to date

It appears my body gets used to the maintenance inhalers. After a few months, they simply stop working. The first maintenance inhaler I used, *Advair*, was effectively useless after the first few months. My doctor at the time would keep increasing strength of it, and after a month or so it would be rendered useless again. Then, somehow, it ended up with me not taking a maintenance inhaler for years -- a very bad idea. Then I went to a new doctor -- mostly to cut down travel distance -- and she put me on *Symbicort*. Symbicort worked far better than Advair ever had, and it helped for a few months. Then we saw the same trend as with Advair: within a few months, it was effectively worthless. Now I have been put on a third maintenance inhaler, *Dulera*. This is also following the same path. My doctor has informed me that if Dulera does not work, we'll have to go with steroids (I believe corticosteroids, but I am not sure) to try to keep the inflammation down.

### Exit, stage left

My asthma is not well controlled, and likely will not be for a while yet, because I am surrounded by things that (for me) trigger asthma attacks. This means that, yes, asthma is a rather large limiting factor in my life. I can't mow the grass, clean up my dog's poop in the back yard, or stay outside for extended periods of time when it's humid, just rained, or the pollen count is high. Things I do not wish to force my Mother to do, I _have_ to because she is the _only person who lives here who is both willing and capable of doing them._ The alternative is me going to the hospital... for _cleaning up dog poop,_ or for _mowing the grass,_ or for _*standing outside at the wrong time of day.*_ It is positively infuriating, but it's how it has to be until my asthma's under control. I am not looking for pity, I am looking for understanding. For everyone to acknowledge, _yes, this *can* happen,_ and not try to fight me over it because they don't believe it.

My asthma is triggered by a wide range of things, so I don't expect people to remember every potential trigger. However, if I mention something you are doing (smoking) or wearing (perfume, cologne) is triggering my asthma, a good first step towards helping me would be to _not_ assume I am lying. All I request is for you to _acknowledge_ that I have asthma _try_ not to cause me to go to the hospital over something so trivial.

What it boils down to is this: Just because you've never seen nor experienced it does not mean it cannot exist. Assuming such is arrogant and hurtful. In some cases, _physically_ hurtful. Someone not believing me can directly lead to me having to go to the hospital. Isn't that something?
