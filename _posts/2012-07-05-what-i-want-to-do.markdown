I've been getting asked many questions, for a few years now, that boil down to _"what do you want to do with your life?"_

The people asking them are not trying to be pushy, it's just that their thing isn't computers, so they don't get that something can have immense value -- both personal and monetary -- without you being able to hold it in your hand.

Today I ran across a video by [Tor Even Mathisen](https://twitter.com/tittentem), courtesy of [a tweet from the SpaceX team](https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/221057357839466496), and it's helped me answer that question.

So, what _do_ I want to do with my life?

One day, I want to work on something that amazes everyone who sees it more than the [Artic Motion](http://vimeo.com/39078923) video I mentioned. Then, I want to give it away for free.

Then I want to repeat that, every single day, until the day I die.

I want to build things that make people stop and wonder, work with it daily for five years, and still stop and wonder every time they pick it up.

And, to top it all off, I want to do it in a sector where everything is generally considered to be worthy of being thrown away: _computing._
