I want to work on something that amazes all who see it.
I want it to be so amazing it steals their breath away.
I want them to see what I have created, and be lost in amazement.
I want that seem feeling to happen every time they see it.
I want to do this with their entire computer. Then I want them to forget it entirely.
I want to do all of that at once, and admire the beautiful paradoxes that arise.

_Then I want to repeat that, every single day, until the day I die._

Every day I cannot, I feel like I am suppressing the very basis of who I am.

I want to create things that make people lost in awe.
I live for the look ontheir faces when that happens.
