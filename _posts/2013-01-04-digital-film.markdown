I recently found the remnants of [Re35](http://re35.net): a 2011 April Fools website about a concept for a device that is inserted into a 35mm film SLR and converts it to digital.

I've heard of various similar things previously, so I started digging around, hoping that it finaly existed.

There's many concepts, but I can find nothing that actually exists. There was [Silicon Film](http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Silicon_Film) in 1998. Then they [appear to have temporarily returned back in 2002](http://www.imaging-resource.com/NEWS/1032460933.html) (but soon disappeared again, sadly). In 2011, there was a [design concept](http://www.yankodesign.com/2011/04/08/digital-camera-with-an-analog-experience/) ([article on wired.com](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/04/digital-film-concept-could-resurrect-dead-film-cameras/)) that came out soon after Re35 was publicized, but I can find no proof that it actually exists. Then, Nikon patented a [digital back for its older film SLRs](http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/18/nikon-patents-digital-sensor-back-for-35mm-film-cameras/) in 2012.

It appears the size constraints inside of a 35mm film SLR seem to be just a bit too much for this sort of idea, at least for ones without a removable back. The only new part of such a product would be that it'd be for a 35mm SLR -- these have existed for medium format cameras for years.
