The internet seems to be an overwhelmingly sad place. I've decided to try my hand at fixing that.

The most direct approach would be to encourage people to tell others they are loved. When contemplating how to approach this, it became apparent that being told "I love you" can trigger reactions that do more harm than good. "What do they want in return?" "Is this a trick?" "I don't know what to say." It is not the message causing problems, it is the presentation. It can trigger negative emotions. What is needed is a neutral presentation of the same idea.

Take away the biases relationships bring.

Take away the urge to reciprocate.

Take away the idea that it must be a mutual feeling.

Now you have quite a different beast. You have something that encourages people to pay it forward, not back. I decided the best aproach would be to use a single fixed message. This meant I needed one short phrase that explained the intent, without the potential emotional baggage.

_"You are loved."_

This sentence is deceiving in its simplicity. The simplicity leaves it devoid of biases: it implies neither platonic nor romantic love, it implies neither worry nor pity. It is a simple statement which is excruciatingly difficult to warp into something negative.

Everybody is loved, and <a href="https://anonymous-love.com">everybody deserves to know that fact.</a>
